## What is API documentation

We can all agree that well-written API documentation saves time for your API users, makes your API product more adoptable, and enhances developer success.

Good ones mean faster and more seamless integration between systems, on top of higher productivity and improved collaboration for developers. Bad ones, on the other hand, mean confused developers, hours spent back and forth on implementation, and frustrated users.

Despite how important API docs are, building and maintaining them are unfortunately not the most fun thing to do. It’s tedious. It’s time-consuming. It’s at the bottom of my list of “things I like to do at work.” I think most developers can agree.

## Why developers need API documentation tools

API documentation platforms are here to help you with that. These tools come with a large range of functions, but they share the same goal—to make creating quality API docs faster, easier, and more efficient. Give your API users the best user experience through features such as autogenerating API endpoint docs, smart error feedback, real-time comments, and docs optimized for live multi-user collaboration.

If you don’t know where to start, no worries! I’ve done my research and here are my picks for the best API documentation tools:
