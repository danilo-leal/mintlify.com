## Joining the Winter 22 Batch

October 13th marked the [deadline](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply) for the W24 batch, taking me back to two years ago when Han and I applied to Y Combinator. 

Our YC batch in Winter 2022 took place during the tail-end of the Covid era tech boom. It was the last fully virtual batch, and it was also the largest YC batch to date.

Getting into YC made us realize that all our time and hard work was worth something and we were ready to throw everything in to build [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/). 

Unfortunately, it also meant that I would have to reneg my offer with [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). I cared a lot about the company and the people there, and if it weren't for starting my own startup, I wouldn't have left this incredible team for anything else.

Looking back, YC is worth it, but not for the reasons I originally thought. 

## The Pros

Before joining, we knew the basics of what YC could bring: the program would let us go all in on our product. They are unique in that they truly invest in teams, while being hands-off to provide the space and freedom to innovate.  

What we got out of YC was that, and so much more.

### Mindset Shift

Many first-time founders are easily drawn into the idea of startup overnight success, but that’s almost never the case. 

Rather, what we saw a lot more of, and what we had to experience ourselves, was failing, reiterating and, going back to scratch for the better.

From Day 1, a handful of core principles were drilled into us—to focus on growth, to launch fast, to build something that users would actually want. These were the pillars that everyone operated on, and our time at YC allowed us to apply these concepts in real time as our product evolved. 
  
YC paired us with group partners who could sit down with us during office hours and act as our sounding board when we needed someone to consult. With their help, we were able to better navigate our decision-making for when to pivot and when to stick it out in the face of challenges (trust me, there were many).

While everything always seems so clear after the fact, in the moment, when we were stuck with countless issues and moving parts, clarity was the one thing we needed the most. Our group partners came in with a wealth of experience and data points, and their guidance was key to helping us find the right footing.

Once, our partner told us that “a product is only a means to provide value to your customer,” and that we should never be attached to our product. Instead, it is only the idea of what we can bring to users that is ever worth holding on to. 

These are words that we still work by today.

### People and Network

<img

When it comes to having a community to lean into throughout your startup journey, the YC network is hard to beat. 

People who join YC have a distinct optimism that you can’t find anywhere else. These are people who believe they can change the world, who put all their time and effort into getting there, and who are eager to help others achieve the same. 

As a B2B SaaS startup whose main customers are other developer-focused businesses, we were also able to gain insight into the needs of these clients through our network of YC alumni who’ve founded developer companies. Their partnership was key to helping us secure our earliest clients. 

Since graduating from YC, we’ve quickly realized that our YC batch peers are one of the few people out there who are on the same path as us. Back then, we racked our brains over the difficulty of creating working MVPs. Now, when we talk about company growing pains and the eternal headache of evolving our product, I know there's a community of founders who I can turn to for advice.

To this day, I'm constantly talking with YC alumni, sharing our learnings openly. I love the community and count many founders as good friends. 

### Investor Dynamics

YC is unique in that it allows members to establish a more even footing with investors through Demo Day. 
 
During Demo Day, founders present their product to different investors and negotiate their valuation by comparing valuation offers between investors. My friend got value from YC as she was raising her seed round— she was immediately able to negotiate better terms. 

Not only does this give founders greater leverage for negotiation, it also enables us to focus more on developing our product leading up to Demo Day and less on talking to investors before then, which tends to be a very time-consuming process.  

Founders are almost always short on time, and having periods of heads-down product building was a much-needed luxury.

## The Cons

Going into YC, we chose to trust the process. What was important to us was getting the leverage we needed to take our product further, and Han and I found the name value and resources that YC could bring to outweigh what they take in equity.

Over the course of our program, YC delivered with its network, expertise, and its promise of an environment built to accelerate growth. It was a bubble, for sure, and it came with both good and bad. 

While at YC, everything and everyone was focused on working towards Demo Day. It was an intense, highly growth-driven environment that called for a near one-track focus on achieving the user numbers to signal that growth. 

Pre-Demo Day, this mindset was great for helping us iterate and set milestones as we took our product through its early stages. Post-Demo Day, however, Han and I soon realized that it was not a healthy mindset to operate on 24/7.

Our time since YC has taught us that running a business is much more complex than just growing numbers. It’s also thinking about how your product can evolve for the better, how you can improve team cohesion, how to hire, when to hire—and by the way, if you’re thinking about [hiring](https://mintlify.crew.work/jobs/), you’re probably thinking about it too late... It is juggling a thousand things, all at the same time. 

Numbers, when all is said and done, are only one side to the multi-faceted equation that is leading a business to success. 

YC does a great job of getting you into the growth mindset, but learning to step out of it from time to time is something that Han and I had to figure out on our own. 

## Parting thoughts on YC  

So, the million dollar question—is YC worth it? 

Yes. Absolutely. Of course. If you take away anything at all from this piece, it is that the pros far outweigh the cons. 

Without YC, I cannot imagine how we would’ve been able to raise our [seed round](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/mintlify-taps-ai-to-automatically-generate-documentation-from-code/) and onboard our first 20 customers. Now, we partner with over 100 YC companies, ranking as the #1 most popular YC product used by other YC companies in the past 3.5 years. 

YC connected us with the people who made our experience; it gave us the opportunity to learn about everything we didn’t know and everything we thought we knew but didn’t. 

Many people I meet in the Bay Area are people in their 20s/early 30s with lots of industry experience in big tech. They have the mindset that they have enough connections & industry experience that they don’t need YC. I disagree— the network and mindset you pick up from the accelerator is invaluable, and not something that can be easily replaced by years in the field. 

YC gave us the confidence and ability to take the startup route— a route that pushes your tolerance for stress, hard work, and caffeine to new limits (nowadays, I live and breathe iced Americanos).

But to think about how rewarding it is to build a product from ground zero and watch it take off—now that is something I don’t think any regular 9-5 can compete with. 

**Also, it's still not too late to apply. We know a ton of founders that got in days before the batch started. Best of luck**
