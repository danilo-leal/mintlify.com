We're excited to announce the launch of **AI Suggestions**, our newest feature to take your docs to the next level.

Powered by [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), Suggestions generates line-by-line recommendations for any page of your docs to improve its content. It is prompt-engineered to take an impact-driven approach that allows you to effortlessly make improvements as small as fixing a typo to significant changes like restructuring.

Suggestions is now available on the [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login) for all startup plan users.

## Why we built Suggestions

Working with brilliant engineers, product leaders, and technical writers has taught us a thing or two about what it takes to build truly outstanding documentation.

One of our most important realizations? While stellar design and functionality are key to the success of your docs, content—from the little things like grammar and syntax, to more abstract aspects like structure and link accessibility—plays an equally vital role.

However, we know top-tier content can be difficult to achieve, especially when you don't have designated writers who consistently update your docs. While we don't believe AI can replace all docs content just yet, we know it can significantly decrease the workload to get to perfection.

## How Suggestions helps you:

Mintlify Suggestions provides content recommendations for three main areas of improvement:

### Structure and Readability

This category targets the general content layout that your users will notice at first glance, including text arrangement, header structure, and custom components. These elements determine the readability of your docs, and Suggestions is here to make sure that your users can easily absorb your content from the moment they lay eyes on it.

### Grammar and Spelling

This section focuses on literacy for users. Suggestions conducts a line-by-line analysis of your content, catching grammatical and spelling errors, as well as offering potential improvements for sentence syntax. Changes in literacy make your docs more accessible for all users, technical or not.

### Links and Accessibility

Broken links and incorrectly tied redirects within your docs are a pain for everyone involved. Suggestions catches them by assessing the functionality of all embedded links, on top of ensuring that the overall document is accessible. A small but mighty little feature, and maybe one of our favorites.

This is just the beginning of Suggestions and we're got much more planned, from indexing suggestions to your brand's tone to writing content from scratch. We’ve got many more areas of recommendation in the works and can’t wait to share them with you!

## Watch it in action

We used Suggestions to improve one of our own pages, [Custom Domains](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings/custom-domain/subdomain/). Here are a few improvements we incorporated:

- Readability: Long-winded sentences of instructions were converted into actionable ordered lists that we found easier to follow
- More Actionable: Headers start with a active verb for consistency and a sense of action for the reader
- Dynamic tone: Overly technical words were made more colloquial and overused terms were spiced up for more variety

Of course, we didn’t take every suggestion. Thankfully, the line-by-line before-and-after design of Suggestions made it super easy to copy only the lines we want.
