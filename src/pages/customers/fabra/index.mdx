Fabra founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nfiacco/" target="_blank">Nick</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colecable/">Cole</a> were quick to realize the importance of smooth and fast-paced customer onboarding.

A startup working with B2B SaaS clients, Fabra’s core offering provides a quick and easy method for firms to build customer-facing data warehouse integrations, so their clients can better close customer deals.

## The Challenge

Soon after launching, the founders soon found themselves overwhelmed onboarding customers via calls and Slack Connect channels. In response to ad-hoc product questions overflowing from their inboxes, they wrote up private Google Docs for each of their customers.

<Quote quote="We had a bunch of details about how to call our APIs and verify payloads etc, in a Google Doc very early on, which is obviously not ideal." />

Lacking the organization required to quickly onboard customers at scale, Nick and Cole needed an immediate solution to effectively communicate with their users.

## The Search to Ensure Customer Success

When it came to searching for a documentation tool that could meet all their needs, Nick and Cole had three core priorities:

1. Beautiful design that matched their brand
2. Open API integration to support their endpoints
3. Version control for easy collaboration and updating

They looked at several documentation providers, but were unhappy with the high levels of involvement required. They didn’t want to manage the deployments themselves and still wanted their docs to exist inside their codebase.

As developers, Nick and Cole needed a solution that blended with their existing processes, not an extra platform to maintain.

## The solution

Mintlify was the answer they were looking for. Three key features stood out to them: beautiful documentation from the get-go, auto-deployment from Git, and a ready-to-use API playground with zero setup.

### Beautiful documentation out of the box

/>

With the Mintlify starter template, the Fabra team had everything they needed already built in: light or dark mode, a well-organized sidebar, and quickstart cards to get their customers set up as easily as possible.

Even better, Fabra found Mintlify’s docs platform to be highly customizable, allowing them to craft every aspect of their docs to highlight the look and feel of their brand.

<Quote quote="Our docs look 10x better now that we use Mintlify, basically out of the box. I always feel super confident sharing them with customers because of how polished they are." />

### Automated deployment from Git

With automated deployment, the team’s time was freed up for other things, so that Nick could focus on maintaining their product and engaging clients.

"The biggest deciding factor for us was the documentation-as-code feature. Having everything auto-deploy from Github was a game changer," he emphasized.

### API playground with no setup

/>

Ease of usage was another key factor for Fabra’s decision making. For the team, Mintlify’s hands-free API playground set-up for all endpoints was astounding.

With Mintlify’s OpenAPI integration, all they had to do was link to an OpenAPI file and their users would be able to interact with their API without ever leaving the documentation.

## Results

With Mintlify, Fabra saves at least 2 hours a week from going back and forth with their users. Rather than leading customers step-by-step through the process, Mintlify’s powerful documentation platform now does the work for Fabra’s team.

With their new docs, users get a comprehensive and intuitive reference for how to integrate the Fabra SDK into their own applications with ease.

<Quote quote="By giving us a competitive advantage in the developer experience, Mintlify has really helped us put our best foot forward." />

Since data warehouse integrations are at the core of Fabra's product, the startup is always working on supporting new data sources. Their toolbox will only grow as their product encompasses more of their customer’s needs.

As Fabra expands their offerings, Mintlify enables the team to add the necessary documentation seamlessly and effortlessly.
